Welcome to the XFab wiki; it only exists thanks to your contributions!

* Members: see the wall in the lobby, and add your tile!
* Please send some pictures of your projects to the Fabmanager.
* Your first project: Nametag to hang on the 3D printer when it's working for you (so we know who to warn in case of a problem):
  * print `accroche.stl`
  * engrave a 40x60mm wooden board with at least name and email (get inspiration from the existing ones)
