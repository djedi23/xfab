Welcome to the XFab wiki!
Its goal is to gather any information useful to its members: link to existing resources, manuals, tested machine settings, tips... It only exists thanks to your contributions!

* Members: see the wall in the lobby, and add your tile!
* Projects: see the presentation book in the eletronics area. Be welcome to add your project!
* Pictures of past projects: please send some pictures of your projects to the Fabmanager.
* Your first project: Nametag to hang on the 3D printer when it's working for you (so we know who to warn in case of a problem):
  * print `accroche.stl`
  * engrave a 40x60mm wooden board with at least name and email (get inspiration from the existing ones)

## Questions
### Printing with .1mm
On the upbox 3D printers, printing with a layer thickness of .1mm almost always results in jamming. Does anyone know how to get to this level of detail, what works and what doesn't?
### White engraving

 <dd>Pour moi il a suffit d'augmenter la puissance du laser (dans la section gravure bien sûr) à 35%.</dd>
